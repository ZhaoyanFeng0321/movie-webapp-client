    "review":"I hesitate to say that a movie is perfect, especially after a first viewing. But gosh dang if this isn't close. And boy does it earn its beefy three hour runtime. Batman was always meant to be a film noir. And it is incredible to me that we haven't seen this before now. This is a mystery crime drama film that happens to feature Batman.",
