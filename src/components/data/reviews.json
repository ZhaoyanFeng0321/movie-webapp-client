    "review": "As I went to the cinema to see Marvel and Jon Watts' third installment of Tom Holland's teenage Spider-Man we had the usual discussion about the differences between a Marvel movie and everything else. And while I had, in the back of my head, Scorsese's claims that Marvel movies are nothing more than entertainment--a claim which I still think is a bit too harsh--we both agreed that this giant's agenda does not contain artistic ambitions--at least not at the expense of the entertainment."

    "review": "Let's get this out of the way first: \"The Batman\" is not a fun movie to watch. That doesn't mean it's bad. But it does take itself really seriously. Which it should, when your main character is brooding 24/7. It seems director Matt Reeves finally made a movie which I feel the caped crusader himself would watch."
